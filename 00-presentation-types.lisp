;; ergo I will define this condition to allow such information to be aquired
;; SEE ALSO: presentation-typep for or, which effectively has to defeat this measure

;; now there are 2 things we need to deal with:-
;; 1. the or type. We can't catch signals from failure of the non terminal bit
;; 2. the cunning optimisation for checking list elements &c which means ?element-type is a function, not a typespec

;; SO. We have:-
;; 1. presentation typespecs
;; 2. presentation types (which will be instances of clos classes)

;; 1 will look very much like standard CL type specifications and will be a superset of them

;; Given the above we will be able to:-
;; 1. determine if an object satisifies some type with presentation-typep
;; 2. ascertain some kind of default presentation typespec for an object
;; 3. accept, from various source, instances of the type
;; 4. present, to various places and in various ways, instances of the type
